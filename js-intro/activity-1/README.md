## Exercise 1: JavaScript Properties and Methods

This is a short exercise to demonstrate the properties and methods of JavaScript objects. As described in [module-4](https://github.com/info343c-a16/m4-git-intro), start by forking and cloning this repository.  Then, edit the `js/main.js` to complete the outlined steps. Because the JavaScript variables you create will not be represented in the DOM, you'll need to open up the `index.html` file, then **inspect your webpage** and confirm you've properly created the variables by using the **console**.
